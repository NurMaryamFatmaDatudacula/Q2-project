				<p class="s"><span class="t">Siamese Cat</span><br>Siamese cats originated in Thailand, an area once known as Siam. The name for the Siamese cat in Thailand is ‘wichien-matt’ which means ‘Moon Diamond’. In Thailand there was this common belief among royalty that they could reincarnate in a Siamese cat and would be able to spend long and lavish lives living in temples and being spoiled by priests and monks. </p>

Although their coat can be found in nearly any color or pattern, they originally were known for their solid, blueish grey colored coat—earning them the nickname of British Blue.</p>

These bruisers have a well-known habit of gently head-butting their favorite people. It's a sign of affection and is usually accompanied by some seriously loud purring.</p>

They're also typically quiet and affectionate cats who enjoy being held, but they're content just lounging around too. They make a perfect, purring lap warmer!</p>

If you pet one, however, you’ll discover they’re not actually hairless. Sphynx cats are covered with a fine layer of downy fuzz. While they’re not plush to the touch, their coats feel akin to suede.</p>

They are very observant of their surroundings, which is one of the things that make them such good hunters. Because of this, it is important to keep them actively engaged for their general well-being and happiness. Treats and interactive toys are a great way to keep their minds busy.</p>

It’s a coat with individual strands that alternate bands of color. Each strand is lighter at the base and becomes gradually darker at the tips. This gives the Abyssinian its exotic, wildcat look.</p>

Exotic Shorthairs are generally very friendly and social, but they can be fearful and shy around people they don’t know. So, if they have to engage with strangers, they will feel a lot more comfortable if they have their favorite human nearby.</p>
